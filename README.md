# GNSS at Camp19

Here I will publish information about my [GNSS Basestation at the ChaosCommunicationCamp2019](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Projects:RTK_GNSS_-_High_Precision_GPS)

Have a look at my [Basestation](https://base.gnss.camp19.quanten.io/).

I have published my processed and raw data from the measurements at the airfield. Have a look into the [repo](https://github.com/quantenProjects/gnss.camp19.quanten.io)
